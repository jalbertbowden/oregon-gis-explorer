    Description:
      Abstract:
        The DLG data files derived from the 1:2,000,000-scale maps contain
        selected base categories of cartographic data in digital form. The data
        files are derived from the sectional maps of the 1970 National Atlas
        of the United States of America. The Boundaries category includes
        boundary information collected in two separate subcategories:
        (1) Political Boundaries and (2) Administrative Boundaries. The
        Hydrography data includes data in three separate subcategories:
        (1) Streams, (2) Water Bodies, and (3) Hypsography (Continental
        Divide only). The Transportation category of data includes major
        transportation systems collected in three separate subcategories: (1)
        Roads and Trails, (2) Railroads, and (3) Cultural Features (airports
        and Alaska pipeline).
      Purpose:
        DLG's depict information about geographic features on or near
        the surface of the Earth, terrain, and political and administrative
        units.  These data were collected as part of the National Mapping
        Program.

<PRE><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of the source
        with hard copy plots.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      The topological structure of each DLG file is fully validated by software.
      There are no extraneous intersections; that is , a line does not join or cross
      another line, or itself, except at a node. No line extends through a node.
      Polygon (area) adjacency is also validated; that is, area left and right topological
      attributes of lines are consistent throughout the file. The neatline is free of gaps.
      Validation of DLG data is performed for each category within a file.
    Completeness_Report:
      For Boundary category:
      Political boundaries:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the
      original source graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to
      digitizing. The Political Boundaries category of data includes States and County
      boundaries.
      Administrative boundaries:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of
      the original source graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to
      digitizing. The Administrative Boundaries category of data includes federally
      administered forests, parks, and wildlife refuges.
      For Hydrography category:
      Streams:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original
      source graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to digitizing.
      The Hydrography category includes perennial and intermittent streams and canals.
      Water Bodies:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original
      source graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to digitizing.
      Water bodies include perennial, intermittent and dry lakes, swamps and glaciers.
      Hypsography:
      Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original source graphic.
      Selective updating of the maps was done prior to digitizing. Hypsography data
      is limited to the Continental Divide.
      For Transportation category:
      Roads and Trails:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original
      source graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to digitizing. The
      Roads and Trails category includes Interstate and primary State highways.
      Railroads:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original source
      graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to digitizing. The railroads
      category of data includes main line and branch line railroads.
      Cultural Features:  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original
      source graphic. Selective updating of the maps was done prior to digitizing.  The
      Cultural Features are limited to airports and the Alaska pipeline.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          Comparison to a graphic source or image source is used as control to assess
          digital positional accuracy.  Cartographic offsets may be present on graphic
          sources, due to scale and legibility constraints.  Data has been vertically aligned
          between categories of data.

        Process_Description:
          This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division
          based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the
          United States of America published by the USGS in 1970.  At the time
          of digitization in the late 1970s, most of the information contained in the
          maps was updated, using the latest available sourcematerials.  The digital
          data were produced by manually digitizing from stable-based copy of the
          graphic material using a digitizing table with a resolution of 0.001 inches
          and an absolute accuracy of 0.003 to 0.005 inches.  The digital data were
          checked for position by visually comparing proof plots with the graphic
          source.  The digital data were checked for classification by manually checking
          proof plots against code listings.
          This file has undergone digital revision.  The digital revision uses ancillary
          source, with no field verification

      Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
        DLG3 attribute codes are used to describe the physical
        and cultural characteristics of DLG node, line, and area
        elements. Attribute codes are used to reduce redundant information,
        provide enough reference information to support integration with larger
        data base, and describe the relationships between cartographic elements.
        Each DLG element has one or more attribute codes composed of a three
        digit major code and a four-digit minor code.
